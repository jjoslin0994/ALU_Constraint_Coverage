# SystemVerilog Functional Coverage Demonstration: 16-bit ALU
This repository contains a SystemVerilog testbench demonstraiting functional coverage priciples and constrained reandomization techniques applied to a 16-bit ALU. Developed as part of the UCF EEE 5703 coursework.

The primary objective of this work was to design and demonstrait meaningful tests and coverage for the ALU functionality. Then to use the power of constraints to optimize coverage with as few test vectors as possible. Here I was able to achieve 100% coverage of the ALU with 64 test vectors. Coverage points included all 9 opcodes, Addition, Subtration, Multiplicaion, AND, OR, NOT, SHL, and SHR. Within each opcode binds such as zero, max, negative were considered for arithmeteic operations. Further cross coverage was used to test outputs of cases such as negatives and roll-over.

The Device Under Test (DUT) is an ALU the professor had generated by some unspecified LLM.
